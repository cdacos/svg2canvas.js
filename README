svn2canvas.js is a simple proof of concept. It uses JS to parse an SVG string and convert it to HTML5 canvas instructions.

Example-0.1.html
----------------
The SVG is placed in a comment in a <div> with class="svg". The example uses jQuery.

The SVG was generated by running potrace on a bitmap (which was created from a scan of a drawing on paper).

Debug mode is enable and returns the canvas instructions in a textarea beneath the canvas.

Example-0.2.html
----------------
Uses svg2canvas-0.2.js. This variation slows the drawing process, with a customisable animation interval (in ms).
