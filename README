svn2canvas.js is a simple proof of concept. It uses JS to parse an SVG string and convert it to HTML5 canvas instructions.

Example.html
------------
The SVG is placed in a comment in a <div> with class="svg". The example uses jQuery.

The SVG was generated by running potrace on a bitmap (which was created from a scan of a drawing on paper).
